                "Lecture": "Hello and welcome! In Language Arts today, we'll share your short stories. It's your chance to present and receive feedback from me. Presenting your story is an essential skill, not just for language arts, but for life in general. Whether you\u2019re sharing with a small group or speaking to a large audience, how you present can make all the difference. \n\nLet\u2019s start with some public speaking tips. One critical aspect is to know your audience. When you present your story, remember who you are sharing it with and consider what might resonate with them. It helps to craft your delivery based on who is listening to your story. \n\nNext, practice is key. Rehearsing your story out loud is an excellent way to familiarize yourself with the material and to smooth out any rough spots before the actual presentation. You may even want to practice in front of a mirror or record yourself to see how you come across. \n\nAnother important tip is to use confident body language. Stand tall, make eye contact, and use gestures naturally. This will make your delivery more engaging and will help you connect with your audience. \n\nLastly, be sure to vary your tone and pace. This keeps the audience engaged and emphasizes important parts of your story. You want to keep them interested and on the edge of their seats. [p] \n\nNow that we\u2019ve covered public speaking tips, let\u2019s move on to responding to feedback. Receiving feedback is a crucial skill for any writer. When you present your story, I\u2019ll be giving you constructive criticism. This should be seen as an opportunity for growth and improvement, not as a personal attack. \n\nFirst and foremost, it\u2019s essential to listen actively. Pay attention to what is being said without interrupting. This demonstrates respect for the feedback and allows you to fully understand the comments being made. \n\nAfter receiving feedback, take a moment to reflect on it before responding. Thank the person for their input, and if necessary, ask clarifying questions. This shows that you value their opinion and are actively seeking to improve. Remember, feedback can lead to the best revisions and ultimately, stronger writing.\n\nWhen revising based on feedback, focus on the suggestions that resonate the most with you. It\u2019s okay to disagree with certain pieces of feedback, but consider why it was given. Not every piece of advice will feel right, but keep an open mind. [p] \n\nFinally, always keep your voice as the author in mind. While feedback is valuable, you should ensure that revisions don\u2019t dilute your unique style. Keeping your voice is paramount in developing your writing. \n\nAs we engage in sharing today, I want you to take these tips into your presentation and the feedback process. Remember, every story is a stepping stone to becoming a better writer and communicator! I'm really looking forward to hearing your stories and giving you feedback to help you finalize them. \n\nThank you for listening, and let\u2019s get started!",
