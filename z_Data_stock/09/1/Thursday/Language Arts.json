                "Lecture": "Hello there! Today, we are going to finish the week by discussing how to write your own poem. This is an exciting opportunity to put what you have learned into practice! As you know from our previous lessons, analyzing poetry helps us understand the techniques poets use to convey feelings and ideas. So, let\u2019s dive into some essential components that will guide your creative process. \n\nOur first topic is rhyming techniques. Rhymes can enhance the musical quality of your poem and provide a rhythm that engages the reader. You can use perfect rhymes, where the sounds are exactly the same, or near rhymes, which have similar but not identical sounds. Additionally, considering the placement of your rhymes is crucial; they can occur at the end of lines, in the middle, or even create internal rhymes. Rhyming adds layers to your expression and can evoke emotions based on how you choose to use it. [p]\n\nTo better understand these concepts, I recommend checking out the Wikipedia article on rhyme, where you will see various examples and types of rhymes discussed in detail [1]. \n\nNow, let\u2019s move on to our second topic: using metaphors and imagery. Metaphors are powerful tools that allow you to draw comparisons between unlike things, which can create deeper meanings in your poetry. For instance, when you say, \u201cTime is a thief,\u201d you communicate the idea that time can take away moments from us, just as a thief would take away possessions. Imagery, on the other hand, involves using language that appeals to our senses\u2014sight, sound, taste, touch, and smell\u2014to help the reader visualize your poem. Creating vivid images makes your writing more impactful and relatable. Think about how you can engage your readers' senses when crafting your lines. [p]\n\nYou can explore more details about metaphors and imagery in poetry through this Wikipedia page [2].\n\nFinally, let\u2019s discuss the peer review of poems. This process is vital for any writer. Sharing your work with others allows you to receive valuable feedback which can improve your writing. When participating in peer review, approach it with an open mind. Be constructive in your critiques\u2014highlight what works in someone else's poem while also providing suggestions for improvements. This collaborative process not only helps the writer but also trains you to become a more critical reader yourself. This experience fosters a community of support and creativity that benefits everyone involved. Throughout writing and sharing, remember that poetry is about expressing yourself, so don\u2019t hesitate to reflect your unique voice. [p]\n\nAt this point, if you're interested in more information, check out the Wikipedia article on peer review [3].\n\n$Break time\n\nNow that you are equipped with these tools, it\u2019s time to put your knowledge into practice! After our break, I want you to draft your own poem using the techniques we\u2019ve discussed: employ rhyming techniques, metaphors, and vivid imagery. Remember, this is about expression, so allow your creativity to flow. Once you've written your poem, we will have a session for peer review where you can share and receive feedback from me and possibly from others in your learning community. \n\nLet\u2019s regroup after the break and get creative!",
