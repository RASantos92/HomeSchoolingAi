                "Lecture": "Continuing with linear equations, yesterday I introduced you to solving for variables. Today, we will practice solving equations with one variable. In mathematics, linear equations are equations of the first degree, meaning they involve only the first power of the variable. Let's start by discussing word problems, as they're a great way to apply what you know about linear equations to real-life situations.\n\nWhen you encounter a word problem, your first step should be to identify the variables involved. Variables represent unknown values that you\u2019ll solve for. For example, in a problem about how many apples you bought, 'x' might represent the number of apples. Clearly identifying your variables helps you set up the equation correctly.\n\nNext, transform the text of the word problem into equations. Read through the problem carefully and look for phrases that suggest mathematical operations\u2014such as 'more than' for addition or 'less than' for subtraction. This skill is essential for translating a real-world scenario into a mathematical equation.[p]\n\nNow, moving on to our next topic: graphing linear equations. Graphing is a vital part of understanding linear equations as it allows you to visualize their solutions. A linear equation can often be expressed in slope-intercept form: y = mx + b, where \u2018m\u2019 is the slope and \u2018b\u2019 is the y-intercept. The slope tells you the steepness of the line, and the y-intercept gives you the starting point where the line crosses the y-axis.\n\nTo graph a linear equation, start by plotting the y-intercept on the graph. From there, you can use the slope to find another point on the line. For every unit you move up or down (depending on whether the slope is positive or negative), move horizontally to the right or left based on the slope\u2019s ratio. Plot the second point and draw the line through both points. This line represents all solutions to the equation.[p]\n\nNow that we understand graphing, let's talk about checking solutions to our linear equations. After you\u2019ve found a solution to an equation, it\u2019s a good idea to verify your answer. You can do this by substituting your solution back into the original equation to see if it makes both sides equal. For example, if your solution for the equation 2x + 3 = 7 is x = 2, plug 2 back into the equation: 2(2) + 3 = 4 + 3, which equals 7. Since both sides of the equation match, your solution is verified! This step is critical in ensuring you haven't made any errors in your calculations or interpretations.[p]\n\nAs a quick recap, today we covered how to tackle word problems by identifying variables and setting up equations, how to graph linear equations and interpret the slope and y-intercept, and finally, how to check your solutions to ensure you\u2019ve solved the equation correctly. [p] I encourage you to practice these skills with different types of problems to reinforce your learning.\n\n$Break time\n\nNow that we have had a moment to rest, let\u2019s quickly summarize what we learned in our lecture today. We began by understanding how to approach word problems, identifying variables, and translating them into equations. We then dove into the methods for graphing linear equations and understanding their representations on a graph. Finally, we discussed the importance of checking solutions to validate our answers. By honing these skills, you are developing a solid foundation in solving linear equations that will support more advanced mathematical concepts in the future.\n\nRemember to practice, and if you have any questions, feel free to ask!",
