                "Lecture": "Hello and welcome back! In our last class, we analyzed conflicts in international relations. Today, we look at the importance of treaties and agreements in maintaining peace. Treaties are formal agreements between countries that outline how they will interact with one another. They can cover a vast array of topics, including trade, defense alliances, environment, and human rights. By agreeing to treaties, countries commit to abiding by certain standards and responsibilities, helping to foster stability and cooperation. Now, let\u2019s explore the different types of treaties that exist, as this will give us a foundational understanding of their significance. One common type of treaty is a bilateral treaty, which involves two countries. A great example of this is the Treaty of Versailles, which ended World War I between Germany and the Allied Powers. Bilateral treaties are often used to address specific issues between two nations. On the other hand, we have multilateral treaties, which involve three or more countries, such as the United Nations Climate Change Agreement. Multilateral treaties are crucial in addressing global issues where cooperation is required from multiple parties. [p]",
