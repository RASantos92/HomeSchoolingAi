To start, we'll have a quiz to test your understanding of integers. Remember, integers are whole numbers and can be positive, negative, or zero. For example, -3, 0, and 7 are all integers. Absolute value, on the other hand, tells us how far a number is from zero on a number line, without considering its direction. So, the absolute value of both -3 and 3 is 3.",
                "summary": "In today's session, you reviewed integers and absolute values through quizzes and games. You tested your knowledge on integers, understanding their nature as whole numbers that include positives, negatives, and zero. You also worked with absolute values, reinforcing the concept of measuring the distance from zero. The practice activities and games helped consolidate these concepts in an interactive manner.",

We'll play a game where you will have to jump on a huge number line. Imagine each of you stands somewhere on this line, and you can only jump to integers based on cards you draw. For example, if you draw a -2 card and your friend draws a 5 card, you need to compute where you\u2019ll land on the number line.",
                "summary": "You engaged in game-based challenges that involved strategic thinking and problem-solving with integers and absolute values. These activities provided a dynamic environment to apply your understanding of these mathematical concepts in real-time scenarios.",
