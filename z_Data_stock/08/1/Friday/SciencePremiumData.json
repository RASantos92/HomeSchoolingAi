                "Lecture": "To conclude our investigation unit, we will review and compare all types of investigations covered this week. Today, we're diving into how we apply these types of scientific investigations and will wrap up with a group project to cement our understanding. Let's begin by revisiting what we've learned. A scientific investigation helps us understand phenomena by systematically asking and answering questions. We've explored descriptive studies, experimental studies, and comparative studies. Now, let's see how these apply to real-world scenarios and use them in our group project.",
                "summary": "Today, we revisited the types of scientific investigations: descriptive, experimental, and comparative studies. We examined their applications and distinctions. Through group projects, you engaged in applying this knowledge practically, reinforcing an understanding of each type's roles, strengths, and limitations.",
