Let's start by reviewing what we've learned about integers. Remember that integers are whole numbers and their negatives. They include numbers like -3, 0, and 4. Imagine these numbers placed on a number line that extends infinitely in both directions. We use integers to count, to measure temperature changes, or even to understand our spending habits in terms of profits and debts.",

                "Lecture": "Next, let's dive into absolute values. The absolute value of a number refers to its distance from zero on the number line, without considering the direction. For instance, both +5 and -5 have an absolute value of 5, because they are both 5 units away from zero. This concept is handy in situations where the direction doesn\u2019t matter, just the magnitude. Imagine you're playing a board game: moving 5 steps forward or backward can be different actions but involve the same effort or movement, and that's where absolute value helps.",
