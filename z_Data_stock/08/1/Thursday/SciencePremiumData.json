                "Lecture": "Today, we will discuss comparative studies and how they differ from experimental studies in scientific research. Let\u2019s start by understanding what comparative studies are. A comparative study is an investigation that compares different groups or conditions to determine relationships or differences. Unlike experimental studies, which involve manipulating variables to observe effects, comparative studies generally observe subjects without altering conditions. [Comparative studies explanation from Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparative_research).",
                "summary": "Today, we explored comparative studies, learning how they differ from experimental studies by focusing on observation rather than manipulation. Through example studies, we analyzed results to understand patterns and correlations that can be drawn from such investigations.",

                "Lecture": "Now, I will share an example study to illustrate this better. Imagine researchers observing various species of plants to compare growth rates under different natural conditions, such as light exposure, without altering these conditions artificially. This comparative approach helps identify factors that naturally influence plant growth.",
                "summary": "By examining example studies, we learned how comparative research helps identify natural patterns and differences across various conditions without altering variables.",

                "Lecture": "Moving on, let\u2019s talk about the analysis of results in comparative studies. Collecting data is just the beginning. Researchers analyze results to identify patterns and correlations. The analysis may involve statistical tools that help make sense of the data. It\u2019s important to remember that unlike experimental studies, comparative studies usually don\u2019t establish causation but rather highlight relationships or differences.
