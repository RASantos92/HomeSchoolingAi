                "Lecture": "Yesterday, we introduced Integers. Today, we will explore incorporating absolute values into problem-solving. Let's start by understanding how integers can be added and subtracted. When you are adding and subtracting integers, you use the number line. For example, adding a positive number involves moving to the right on the number line, while adding a negative number involves moving to the left. Similarly, subtracting a positive number means moving to the left, and subtracting a negative number means moving to the right. Let's try an example: if you have -3 + 5, you move 3 units left to reach -3, then 5 units right to reach 2. Can you see how it works? Now let's move on to understanding the absolute value in real-life situations. The absolute value of a number is its distance from zero on the number line, regardless of direction. Absolute values are used in various real-life contexts such as measuring distances and understanding the magnitude of differences. Imagine two cities to the north and south of a starting point. The absolute values help in determining the distance between these points, ignoring direction. Let's say city A is 50 miles north and city B is 70 miles south. Using absolute value, the distance from the starting point to city B is 70 miles, irrespective of north or south direction. After this brief overview, let's take a short break and absorb what we've learned. $Break time. I hope you are refreshed and ready to continue!",
                "summary": "Today, you have learned how to add and subtract integers using the concept of a number line. You also explored the significance of absolute values in real life, understanding them as the distance from zero on the number line, regardless of direction. These concepts are fundamental in developing your problem-solving skills related to integers and will be useful as we progress in our studies.",
