                "Lecture": "Welcome back, students! Yesterday, we began our exploration of literature. Today, we will delve deeper into poetry and its different forms. Poetry is a unique expression of feelings and ideas through rhythm, sound, and imagery. Let\u2019s start by discussing the **types of poetry**. There are various forms that we will be focusing on today, including the Sonnet and Haiku. \n\nA **Sonnet** is a poetic form that consists of 14 lines, typically written in iambic pentameter. It often follows a specific rhyme scheme, which can vary from the Shakespearean structure to the Petrarchan. The beauty of the Sonnet lies in its ability to convey deep emotions and thoughts succinctly within its confines. \n\nOn the other hand, we have the **Haiku** \u2013 a traditional Japanese form of poetry consisting of just three lines with a syllabic pattern of 5-7-5. Haikus often focus on nature and encapsulate a moment in time, creating vivid imagery with very few words. \n\nNow, let\u2019s talk about **analyzing poetic devices**. Poets use various tools to enhance their expressions. Devices such as metaphor, simile, alliteration, and imagery play a crucial role in conveying moods and emotions. For example, a metaphor directly compares two unrelated things, which can create powerful imagery and resonance in a poem. Analyzing these devices helps us understand the deeper meanings behind the words. \n\nAdditionally, structures such as rhythm and meter are important as they contribute to the poem\u2019s flow and musicality. Pay attention to how these elements work together to create the overall feeling of the poem. \n\nNow, let\u2019s take a short **$Break time**. I want you to think about your favorite poems and consider the poetic devices the authors might have used. \n\nWelcome back! As we continue, let\u2019s put our new knowledge into practice by **writing simple poems**. You can choose to write a Sonnet or a Haiku, but I encourage you to try both! For the Sonnet, remember to maintain the 14-line structure and a consistent rhyme scheme. Think about a theme or emotion you want to convey. For the Haiku, simply observe your surroundings or your feelings and express that moment using the 5-7-5 syllable structure. Remember, the magic of poetry comes from your personal expression! \n\nOnce you\u2019ve written your poems, we\u2019ll share them and discuss the poetic devices you\u2019ve employed. This will not only help you learn from each other but also reinforce our understanding of poetry. We will spend the next 20 minutes on this exercise. After that, we\u2019ll regroup for a discussion on our poetry. \n\nLastly, let\u2019s wrap up our lesson today with a **summary**. Today, you learned about the different forms of poetry, including Sonnet and Haiku, and how to analyze poetic devices. You also had the chance to express your creativity by writing your own poems. Remember, poetry is not just about following rules; it\u2019s about expressing yourself in the most genuine way possible. I look forward to hearing your thoughts and feelings in the poems you created! Let\u2019s keep exploring the fascinating world of literature together!",
