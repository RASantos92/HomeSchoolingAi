                "lecture": "For today\u2019s session in mathematics, we\u2019ll solve more challenging problems that involve multiple integer operations in a single calculation. This is a crucial step in understanding how to work with integers effectively.\n\nLet's begin by discussing the order of operations when dealing with integers. Remember the acronym PEMDAS which stands for Parentheses, Exponents, Multiplication and Division (from left to right), Addition and Subtraction (from left to right). It is essential to follow this order to arrive at the correct answer.  \n[p] \nFor example, consider the expression 2 + 3 \u00d7 (4 - 1). First, we solve the operation in the parentheses: (4 - 1) equals 3. Now the expression looks like this: 2 + 3 \u00d7 3. Next, we perform the multiplication: 3 \u00d7 3 equals 9. Finally, we add 2 + 9, which gives us a result of 11. So, always remember to use the order of operations when working with integers, as it can significantly influence the outcome. \n[p]\nNow let's practice applying this order of operations with some integers. Try solving the following problems on your own: \n1. 5 - 2 \u00d7 3 + 4\n2. (6 + 4) \u00f7 2 - 1 \nMake sure to perform the operations in the correct order, and let's see what answers you come up with. Be mindful of performing multiplication and division before addition and subtraction! \n[p] \nAs you work on these problems, let\u2019s transition to discussing some challenging integer problems that can commonly be found in mathematics. These types of problems often require deep thinking and careful consideration of all the operations involved. Sometimes, they can be tricky, so pay close attention! \n[p] \nLet's consider a multi-step integer problem: If a store sells 25 apples, and then, due to a special offer, they sell 10 more apples. However, they later discover that 15 apples were returned. How many apples do they have left? \nTo solve this, we first add the apples sold: 25 + 10 equals 35 apples sold. Then we subtract the returned apples: 35 - 15 equals 20 apples remaining. \n[p] \nI encourage you to think about how you can break these challenges down into simpler steps. It is like peeling an onion layer by layer. Start with what you know, and progressively work through until you reach the answer. You should also be practicing word problems where you identify integers within the text.  \n[p] \nHere's another problem with various operations: A train travels 60 miles north, then 30 miles south. It then travels 15 miles north again. How far is the train from the starting point? \nTo find the solution, start with the distance traveled north: 60 - 30 = 30 miles after the first two trips, and then, adding the last part: 30 + 15 = 45 miles. \n[p] \nChallenging problems like these often require you to think critically and apply your integer operation skills creatively. Practice helps make perfect, so don't hesitate to work on various problems to fully embrace the concept of integer operations.\n\nIn summary, we have explored how to apply the order of operations using integers effectively. We have practiced determining answers to increasingly complex integer problems. Make sure you feel confident in solving both types of problems; having a strong foundation will prepare you for more advanced mathematics in the future.\n\nAs we wrap up today\u2019s lecture, reflect on these key areas: the order of operations, how to break down complex problems into manageable steps, and the significance of practicing more challenging integer problems.\n\nRemember, mastering integers will elevate your overall mathematics skills. Keep practicing, and gradually, these operations will feel like second nature!\n\nMain Topic: Integer Operations\nSub Topics: Order of operations with integers, Challenging integer problems\n\nWikipedia References:\n1. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Order_of_operations\n2. https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Integer_(mathematics)",
