                "lecture": "Hello! Today\u2019s science class will involve practical applications by using models to represent atomic structures and periodic table elements. This will help us visualize and understand the concepts we are discussing. We will break this lecture down into two main subtopics: building models of atoms and discussing periodic properties and trends.\n\nLet\u2019s start with the first subtopic: building models of atoms. An atom is essentially the smallest unit of an element that retains the properties of that element. It\u2019s composed of three primary particles: protons, neutrons, and electrons. \n\nProtons are positively charged particles found in the nucleus of an atom. The number of protons in an atom defines what element it is. For example, if an atom has one proton, it is hydrogen. If it has six, it is carbon. Neutrons are neutral particles also located in the nucleus, while electrons are negatively charged and orbit the nucleus in various energy levels. The balance between the number of protons and electrons gives the atom an electrical neutrality overall.\n\nTo build a model of an atom, you can think of using simple materials to represent these particles. For example, you might use different colored balls to represent protons, neutrons, and electrons. The nucleus of the atom, where the protons and neutrons are found, could be represented by a larger ball, while smaller balls would represent the electrons orbiting around it. This model can help visualize how these particles are arranged and the overall structure of an atom. [p]  \n\nNow, let\u2019s pause for a moment and gauge your understanding so far. Can you picture how the particles of an atom are arranged based on what we\u2019ve discussed? Now, if you want to deepen your understanding, I encourage you to check out the Wikipedia page on atomic structure. This provides excellent visuals and additional information.\n\nNext, let\u2019s move to our second subtopic: periodic properties and trends. The periodic table is a systematic arrangement of elements based on their atomic number, electron configurations, and recurring chemical properties. As you move across a period from left to right, several trends can be observed. \n\nOne key property is electronegativity, which is the tendency of an atom to attract electrons in a bond. Generally, electronegativity increases as you move from left to right across a period. This is due to the increasing positive charge in the nucleus, which pulls the electrons closer. Conversely, as you move down a group in the periodic table, electronegativity decreases because the additional electron shells shield the nucleus from attracting bonding electrons effectively.\n\nAnother interesting trend is atomic radius, which is the size of an atom. The atomic radius decreases across a period from left to right. The reason for this reduction is that as you add protons to the nucleus, the increased positive charge pulls the electrons closer to the nucleus, reducing the overall size of the atom. However, as you go down a group, atomic radius increases due to the addition of electron shells, which outweighs the increased nucleus charge and causes an expansion of the atomic size.\n\nYou might also encounter the concepts of ionization energy, which is the energy required to remove an electron from an atom. Like electronegativity, ionization energy increases across a period and decreases down a group. [p] \n\nNow that we\u2019re nearing the end of our lecture, let\u2019s reflect on what you have learned today. We have discussed how atoms are structured, including their protons, neutrons, and electrons. We also created an understanding of how to build models of atoms. Additionally, we explored the periodic table and discussed the trends in electronegativity, atomic radius, and ionization energy. To better grasp these concepts, I recommend visiting the Wikipedia pages on atomic structure and periodic table trends.\n\nIn summary, today was an insightful exploration into atomic structures and how they fit into the larger context of the periodic table. We learned about the basic components of atoms and the significant trends that exist in the periodic table that influence their behavior. By analyzing these models and properties, you should now have a clearer understanding of both topics and their relevance in the wider field of science.\n\nRemember, a strong foundation in atomic structure and the periodic table will lead you to greater insights in chemistry and beyond.
