                "lecture": "Hello everyone! Today marks our exciting assessment day where we will review our knowledge of whole numbers. This will not only be an evaluation of what you have learned this week, but it will also be fun and engaging! We have a couple of different activities planned to help reinforce what you have learned about whole numbers, so let\u2019s dive right in!\n\nFirst up, we\u2019ll start with some review games. These games are designed to help you recall important concepts about whole numbers, including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. You\u2019ll be allowed to work at your own pace, and I encourage you to think about strategies as you play. Remember, the goal is not just to find the right answer, but to understand how you got there. [p]\n\nAfter our review games, we'll take a few minutes for individual reflection. During this time, I want you to think about what strategies worked well for you during the games and what areas you might still be unsure about. You can jot down your thoughts in a notebook if you have one available. Reflecting on your own learning process is key to improvement! [p]\n\nNow, once we\u2019ve reflected, we\u2019ll move onto a performance assessment. This will be a more formal check on your understanding of whole numbers, where you will encounter various problems that reflect what you have learned throughout the week. It\u2019s important to read each question carefully and show your work, so I can see the process you used to arrive at your answer. [p]\n\nAs we engage in these activities, remember that this is not just about scoring well; it\u2019s about learning and growing in your understanding of whole numbers. So, let\u2019s have fun, learn together, and see how well you can apply what you've learned so far! [p]",
                "summary": "In today\u2019s lesson, we engaged in review games to reinforce your understanding of whole numbers and their operations. You had the opportunity to reflect on your learning, considering what strategies worked best for you. Lastly, through a performance assessment, you had the chance to demonstrate your understanding of the concepts we covered this week. This holistic approach allows us to not only assess knowledge but also to encourage a growth mindset towards learning!",
