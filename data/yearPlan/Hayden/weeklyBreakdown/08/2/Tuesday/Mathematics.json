                "lecture": "Building on our previous lesson, we will apply factors and multiples in problem-solving scenarios. \n\nTo start, let\u2019s define what factors are. Factors are numbers that can be multiplied together to get another number. For example, if we take the number 12, its factors are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12. This means that you can multiply 1 and 12, 2 and 6, or 3 and 4 to result in 12. \n\nUnderstanding factors helps us recognize how numbers interact with one another. Factors are important because they help us form the basis of many mathematical concepts, such as divisibility and simplifying fractions. [p] \n\nNext, let\u2019s discuss multiples. Multiples are what you get when you multiply a number by an integer. For instance, the multiples of 3 are 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, and so on. It\u2019s essentially the counting by that number. Something crucial to remember is how factors and multiples relate\u2014they are inverse operations. If 3 is a factor of 12, then 12 is a multiple of 3. This relationship will be pivotal as we proceed through various problems. [p]  \n\nNow, moving onto prime numbers. A prime number is defined as a natural number greater than 1 that cannot be formed by multiplying two smaller natural numbers. This means that a prime number can only be divided evenly by 1 and itself. Examples of prime numbers include 2, 3, 5, 7, 11, and 13. \n\nIdentifying prime numbers is essential because they are the building blocks of all whole numbers. They play a crucial role in the fundamental theorem of arithmetic, which states that every integer greater than 1 can be expressed as a unique product of prime numbers. [p] \n\nNext, let\u2019s dive into finding common factors. Finding common factors involves identifying factors that two or more numbers share. For example, if we consider the numbers 12 and 18, the factors of 12 are 1, 2, 3, 4, 6, and 12. The factors of 18 are 1, 2, 3, 6, 9, and 18. The common factors here are 1, 2, 3, and 6. \n\nUnderstanding common factors is useful particularly in simplifying fractions and finding least common multiples. We will practice a few exercises to solidify this skill shortly. [p] \n\nAs we wrap up this first section of our lecture, I encourage you to think about how factors and multiples interact, especially how identifying prime numbers helps in finding factors efficiently. \n\nNow, let\u2019s take a $Break time for five minutes. After that, we will do some practice problems that involve factors and multiples, and we\u2019ll explore how to solve for common factors effectively. [p] \n\n**(After break)**\n\nWelcome back! Now that we\u2019ve talked about factors and multiples, let\u2019s apply what we\u2019ve learned to some problems. We'll work together on a few examples, and I'll guide you through the process step-by-step. \n\nFor our first problem, let\u2019s find the factors of 24. Can you list the numbers that multiply to give us 24? [Student answers] Great! Now let\u2019s see if we can find the prime factorization of 24. This means we will express 24 as a product of prime numbers. What would you say are the prime factors here? [Student answers] Excellent work!\n\nNext, we\u2019ll find the least common multiple of two numbers, say 8 and 12. To do this, we first list the multiples of both numbers. [Student examples] Now can you identify the least common multiple? [Student answers] \n\nThen, let\u2019s practice finding common factors. We can take the numbers 30 and 45. Can you list the factors for both\u2014then, can you find the common ones? [Student works through this task]\n\nAs we conclude our problem-solving session today, I hope you gained clarity in working with factors and multiples, prime numbers, and finding common factors. Understanding these concepts gives you a stronger foundation for more complex mathematical problems in the future. \n\nIn summary, today, you learned the concepts of factors and multiples, prime numbers, and strategies for finding common factors. You realized the vital relationships among these concepts, which are crucial in mathematics. Keep practicing these skills, and soon they will become second nature!\n\n**Main Topic:** Factors and Multiples  \n**Sub Topics:** Prime Numbers, Finding Common Factors",
