                "title": "Solving One-Step Equations with Fractions and Mixed Numbers",
                "lecture": "Hello there! In today's advanced math class, we will continue practicing solving one-step equations, introducing equations with fractions this time. One-step equations are equations that can be solved in a single operation. As we expand our knowledge, we will specifically focus on integrating fractions and mixed numbers into these equations.\n\nLet\u2019s start with understanding what one-step equations are. A one-step equation is an equation that can be solved by performing just one mathematical operation. For example, if I say x + 5 = 12, all you need to do to solve for x is to subtract 5 from both sides. Similarly, if I have the equation x - 7 = 3, you would add 7 to both sides to find x. \n\nNow, why are we including fractions in our equations? Fractions can oftentimes be present in equations, especially in real-world applications. Working with fractions requires us to apply our knowledge of basic operations\u2014addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division\u2014applied directly to numerators and denominators. \n\nLet\u2019s discuss how to handle equations that include fractions. For instance, consider this equation: 1/2 x = 6. Here, x is multiplied by one half. To isolate x, you would multiply both sides of the equation by 2 because multiplying by the reciprocal of a fraction cancels out the fraction. So you would write: 2 * (1/2) x = 6 * 2. That simplifies to x = 12. Remember, the key is to perform the same operation on both sides of the equation to maintain the balance of the equation. [p]\n\nNow, let\u2019s practice solving another equation that involves a fraction: 3/4 x = 9. To solve this, what we want to do first is multiply both sides by the reciprocal of 3/4, which is 4/3. So you multiply both sides: (4/3) * (3/4)x = 9 * (4/3). This gives us x = 36/3, which simplifies to x = 12. This shows us how equations with fractions can be solved by using their reciprocals. [p]\n\nNext, let\u2019s move to mixed numbers. A mixed number is a number that consists of a whole part and a fractional part, for example, 2 1/3. The concept remains the same; if we include mixed numbers in our equations like this: x + 2 1/3 = 5, we start by converting the mixed number to an improper fraction. So, 2 1/3 converts to 7/3. Now, our equation looks like x + 7/3 = 5. To isolate x, subtract 7/3 from both sides of the equation. This transforms our equation into x = 5 - 7/3. To perform this operation, we need a common denominator. 5 can be written as 15/3, so now we have x = (15/3) - (7/3). This results in x = 8/3. Remember, it is essential to convert the mixed numbers correctly to simplify your calculation. [p]\n\nNow, let me give you one more example involving a fraction and a mixed number for practice. Consider the scenario: x - 1 2/5 = 3. First, convert 1 2/5 into an improper fraction which gives us 7/5. So the equation is x - 7/5 = 3. Now, we add 7/5 to both sides of the equation, giving x = 3 + 7/5. Converting 3 into a fraction gives us 15/5, hence x = (15/5) + (7/5) which results in x = 22/5.\n\nNow that we\u2019ve tackled handling fractions and mixed numbers within equations, remember that the process remains fundamentally the same: isolate the variable by performing the opposite operation, while ensuring to maintain the equality of the equation. Practicing more examples will reinforce your understanding. [p]\n\nTo summarize today\u2019s lecture, you have learned how to solve one-step equations, incorporating both fractions and mixed numbers into your calculations. You practiced isolating variables by using reciprocal fractions and converting mixed numbers to improper fractions, ensuring that you maintain balance on both sides of the equation. Understanding these concepts will enhance your ability to handle more complex equations in the future. [p]\n\nFor your reference and further reading, check out:\n1.
