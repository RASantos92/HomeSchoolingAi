                "lecture": "Welcome to today\u2019s lesson! In today's math lesson, we will explore integers, which are whole numbers that can be positive, negative, or zero, and learn about absolute value, which represents the distance from zero on a number line. Let\u2019s begin by looking at the concept of integers.\n\nIntegers can be defined as the set of whole numbers that include positive numbers, negative numbers, and zero. This means the integers consist of ...1, 0, 1, 2, 3... and on the negative side, we have... -1, -2, -3, and so on. The great thing about integers is that they allow us to represent values in a clear and structured way on the number line. [p]\n\nNext, let\u2019s visualize this using a number line. When you look at a number line, it extends infinitely in both directions, with zero located in the center. On the right side of zero, you find all positive integers, while on the left side, you find all negative integers. For example, if we look at -3, 0, and +2 on a number line, we would find that -3 is three units to the left of zero,\n0 is at the center, and +2 is two units to the right of zero. This representation helps us understand the relative distance between numbers. [p]\n\nNow let\u2019s talk about comparing integers. Comparing integers helps us understand which numbers are greater than or less than others. To do this, we use the number line as our guide. For example, if we want to compare -1 and -2, we look at their positions on the number line. Since -1 is to the right of -2, it is greater than -2. In contrast, if we compare +4 and -2, we can see that +4 is obviously greater than -2 because it lies to the right. [p]\n\nIt's important to remember that the farther you move to the left of zero on the number line, the smaller the integer value becomes. So, for example, -10 is less than -5, and -4 is greater than -8. [p]\n\nNow, let\u2019s talk about absolute value. The absolute value of an integer refers to its distance from zero on the number line, regardless of its direction. It is denoted by vertical bars around the number. For instance, the absolute value of both -3 and +3 is 3, because both numbers are three units away from zero. [p]\n\nUnderstanding absolute value is crucial for various applications in math. For instance, you can use absolute value to find the distance between two points on a number line. If you want to find the distance between -4 and +2, you would perform the calculation: | -4 - 2 | = |-6| = 6 units apart. [p]\n\nAnother application is in real-life situations like temperature. If the temperature is -5 degrees and later rises to +3 degrees, knowing the absolute values helps us understand the fluctuation of temperature.\nThe absolute value allows us to disregard the direction of the temperature change, focusing solely on its magnitude. [p]\n\nTo summarize what we have learned today, we covered integers and how they include all positive and negative whole numbers as well as zero. We discussed the number line representation of integers and how it aids us in comparing them based on their relative positions. Furthermore, we explored absolute value as a means to determine the distance of a number from zero and learned about its applications in both mathematics and real-world scenarios. [p]\n\nBy understanding these concepts, you are better equipped to tackle problems involving integers and absolute values!\n\n### Summary:\n1. Integers are whole numbers that can be positive, negative, or zero.\n2. The number line helps visualize integers and their relationships.\n3. Comparing integers involves determining which is greater or less using their positions on the number line.\n4. Absolute value refers to the distance from zero and is always a non-negative number.\n5. Applications of absolute value can include finding distances on a number line and measuring temperature changes.\n\n### Main Topic: \n- Integers and Absolute Value\n\n### Sub Topics:\n- Number line representation\n- Comparing integers\n- Applications of absolute value\n\n### Wikipedia References:\n1.
