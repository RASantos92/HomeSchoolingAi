                "lecture": "Welcome to our advanced math class! Today, we\u2019re diving deep into the world of one-step equations. This is not just about numbers or abstract concepts; it\u2019s about understanding how these equations can be utilized in real-world situations. To kick things off, let\u2019s first define what a one-step equation is. \n\nA one-step equation is an equation that requires only one operation to solve for the unknown variable. For example, equations like `x + 5 = 10` or `3x = 12` are one-step equations. The goal is to isolate the variable on one side of the equation. \n\nNow, let\u2019s start with the first part of our lecture, which is Applied Mathematics. This branch of mathematics is concerned with mathematical techniques that are typically used in scientific, engineering, business, and other fields. Applied mathematics could involve various operations and equations, including our focus today; one-step equations.\n\nLet\u2019s consider a simple scenario to illustrate an applied math problem. Imagine you're saving money to buy a new video game that costs $50. You currently have $30 saved up. To find out how much more money you need, you can set up the equation:  `x + 30 = 50`. Here, `x` represents the additional amount you need to save. To solve for `x`, we subtract 30 from both sides: \n\n```\n x + 30 - 30 = 50 - 30\n x = 20\n```\n\nSo, you need to save an additional $20. [p]  This example shows you how one-step equations can be used in everyday life when making plans and budgeting.\n\nNow, let\u2019s move on to word problems with scenarios. Word problems are a great way to see how math translates into real life. Let\u2019s explore another scenario. Suppose you\u2019re participating in a charity run, and the entry fee is $15. You decide to fundraise and want to know how much more money you need to raise if your goal is to gather $75.\n\nWe can represent this situation with the equation: `y + 15 = 75`, where `y` is the amount you need to raise. To isolate `y`, you\u2019ll subtract 15 from both sides: \n\n```\n y + 15 - 15 = 75 - 15\n y = 60\n```\n\nHere, you have determined that you need to raise $60 more for your charity run. [p] This not only highlights how one-step equations are practical, but also emphasizes the importance of math in contributing to your community.\n\nNow that we have established how one-step equations can apply to real scenarios, let\u2019s delve into some tips for solving one-step equations effectively.  \n\nFirst, always remember to maintain balance in your equations. This means whatever operation you perform on one side of the equation must also be performed on the other side to keep it equal. Second, practice identifying keywords in word problems that hint at the operations needed. For example, phrases such as \u201cmore than\u201d or \u201cless than\u201d can help you recognize when to add or subtract.\n\nLet\u2019s analyze an example of a word problem in detail. Consider the following: You are given a puzzle where the sum of a number and six is twenty. To formulate a one-step equation, let\u2019s denote the unknown number as `z`. The equation can be structured as: `z + 6 = 20`.\n\nTo find the value of `z`, we solve it by performing a subtraction operation: \n\n```\n z + 6 - 6 = 20 - 6\n z = 14\n```\n\nIn this case, you\u2019ve discovered that the number is 14. [p] This exercise also illustrates how vital it is to comprehend the context of the problem to set up the equation correctly.\n\nNow, while working through these scenarios, I encourage you to always check your work. After solving, it\u2019s essential to substitute the variable back into the original equation to verify that it meets the conditions set forth. For instance, if we check our previous solution by substituting `z` back into the original equation: \n\nIf `z = 14`, then substituting gives us: \n```\n 14 + 6 = 20\n```\nWhich confirms our solution is correct. [p]\n\nLet\u2019s apply these concept skills in another problem. This time we have a situation: Jamie buys 3 pizzas for a party, and each pizza costs `p` dollars. If Jamie spends a total of $24, we need to find out how much each pizza costs.\n\nTo set up the equation, we have: `3p = 24`. Now, to isolate `p`, we need to divide both sides by 3: \n```\n 3p \u00f7 3 = 24 \u00f7 3\n p = 8\n```\nHence, each pizza costs $8. [p] This reinforces the practicality of using one-step equations to solve problems in everyday scenarios.\n\nBefore we conclude today\u2019s lecture, let\u2019s summarize what we\u2019ve covered. We\u2019ve defined one-step equations and explored their practical applications in daily life, particularly through budgeting and fundraising scenarios. We also practiced tackling word problems and reinforced the tips for solving equations effectively, focusing on key operations and maintaining balance.\n\nYour ability to employ one-step equations to navigate real-world situations is a powerful skill. Revisit these concepts to strengthen your understanding and problem-solving skills.\n\nIn summary, one-step equations may seem basic at first, but they form the foundation for more complex mathematical concepts. Whether you find yourself budgeting for a video game or participating in a charity run, recognizing how to form and solve these equations will greatly benefit you.\n\nAs you continue your studies, I encourage you to explore more problems and scenarios. The more you practice, the more comfortable you\u2019ll become with using one-step equations to solve real-world challenges.\n\nFor further reading, you may refer to the links below:\n1.
