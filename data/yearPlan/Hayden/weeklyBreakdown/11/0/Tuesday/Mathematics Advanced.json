                "lecture": "Welcome back! Today we're going to tackle more one-step equations and introduce some word problems that require us to set up and solve equations. Solving one-step equations is an essential skill in mathematics that helps us find the value of a variable. A one-step equation is an equation that can be solved in one operation, whether it's addition, subtraction, multiplication, or division. Let's dive into the subject!\n\nTo start, it's important to understand how to translate phrases into equations. Translating words into mathematical expressions is crucial because real-world problems often come in verbal form. For example, if I say, \"The sum of a number and 5 is 10,\" how do we turn that statement into an equation? We can represent the unknown number with a variable, often using 'x'. So, our equation will look like this: x + 5 = 10. Here, we have translated a phrase into a mathematical equation. The operation we need to perform here is subtraction, which will help us isolate the variable on one side of the equation. \n\nDo you see how we can convert sentences into equations? It\u2019s all about identifying keywords. For instance, when you see the word \"sum,\" think of addition, while \"difference\" refers to subtraction. Similarly, \"product\" indicates multiplication, and \"quotient\" means division. Recognizing these keywords will greatly assist you in translating word problems into equations. [p]\n\nNow that we\u2019ve touched on translating phrases into equations, let\u2019s look at some real-life applications of equations. One-step equations are not just numbers on a page; they help us solve real-life problems. Consider this scenario: you earn $15 for each hour you work, and you want to find out how many hours you need to work to make $150. At first glance, this might seem like a puzzle. However, we can turn this situation into a one-step equation. \n\nLet\u2019s denote the number of hours worked as \u2018h.\u2019 Our goal is to find the value of \u2018h\u2019 when we know that 15h = 150. Can you see how that equation now represents the situation? To solve for h, we divide both sides by 15, giving us h = 10. This means you need to work 10 hours to earn $150. It's fascinating how equations can relate to our own experiences and make understanding everyday situations easier! [p] \n\nMoving forward, let\u2019s practice solving several one-step equations. The first equation is 7x = 35. Can you identify what operation needs to be performed here to isolate x? Yes, we divide both sides by 7. When we do that, we find x = 5. Let\u2019s try another example: x - 4 = 12. In this case, we will add 4 to both sides of the equation to isolate x. This gives us x = 16. As you solve more problems, you\u2019ll recognize patterns that help you solve equations more efficiently. [p] \n\nLet's also consider the importance of checking your answers. After solving an equation, it\u2019s a good practice to substitute your solution back into the original equation. For example, if we take our first equation, x = 5, and substitute it into 7x = 35, we check 7(5) = 35. Since this statement is true, we know our answer is correct. Always verify your solutions! [p]\n\nNext, let\u2019s discuss how we approach word problems involving equations. These problems often require extra steps beyond simply solving for x. Here\u2019s another scenario: A bottle contains x ounces of water. You pour out 2 ounces, and now you have 12 ounces left. How can we turn this information into a one-step equation? The equation can be set up as follows: x - 2 = 12. By adding 2 to both sides, we find x = 14. You began with 14 ounces of water before pouring out 2 ounces. Once again, notice how we translated words into an equation and solved it efficiently. [p]\n\nIt\u2019s also helpful to visualize equations when solving them. Sketching a diagram, especially for word problems that involve physical objects or relationships, can provide clarity and make the equations easier to formulate. For our previous example about the water in the bottle, thinking about the bottle\u2019s capacity can help conceptualize the problem. Visual aids can enhance your understanding, even if they\u2019re just mental images! [p]\n\nAs we conclude today\u2019s lecture, I want you to remember that translating phrases into equations can open up a world of mathematical reasoning and understanding in our daily lives. Not only that, but solving one-step equations builds a foundation for tackling more complex problems in mathematics. In real life, whether you're calculating costs, budgeting, or measuring ingredients for a recipe, these equations provide us the tools to navigate various situations logically.\n\nIn summary, today you learned how to translate phrases into equations based on key words, apply one-step equations to real-world problems, solve and check solutions for these equations, as well as use visualization to aid comprehension. Take pride in your ability to relate mathematics to real life, and keep practicing.
