                "lecture": "Hello! We're back to integers and absolute value! Today, we'll practice applying these concepts through various real-world problems. Let's start with integers. An integer is a whole number that can be positive, negative, or zero. For example, -2, 0, and 5 are all integers. You might wonder why integers are important. Well, they are fundamental in mathematics, especially when we work with temperature changes, financial transactions like profits and losses, or even elevation levels.\n\nNow, let\u2019s look into some word problems involving integers. Here\u2019s a classic example: imagine you are in a location where the temperature is -5 degrees Celsius and later rises by 10 degrees. How would we express this situation using integers? \n\nWe begin at -5 and then move upwards 10. So, we\u2019d calculate it like this: -5 + 10 = 5. Therefore, the temperature after the increase is 5 degrees Celsius. [p] \n\nWord problems can also involve loss and gain scenarios. Suppose you owe $30 (which we represent as -30) and you earn $50. How do we find out how much money you have now? \n\nYou could express your new balance with integers by calculating: -30 + 50 = 20. So, you would have $20. This illustrates how integers can represent real-life scenarios. [p] \n\nLet's delve deeper into another example. Suppose your friend is currently at a certain elevation of -150 meters below sea level and climbs up 100 meters. To find out the new elevation, we will compute -150 + 100. This results in -50 meters, meaning your friend is still below sea level but closer to the surface. Word problems allow us to visualize how integers operate in various contexts. [p] \n\nMoving forward, let\u2019s discuss absolute value. The absolute value of a number is its distance from zero on the number line, regardless of direction. Hence, the absolute value of -3 is the same as the absolute value of 3, both are 3. We write this as |3| = 3 and |-3| = 3. [p] \n\nWhy is absolute value important? Consider this real-world application: suppose you want to measure the difference in temperature between -7 degrees and 3 degrees. Here, we need to use absolute value to find the distance between them. We can set this up as follows: |3 - (-7)| = |3 + 7| = |10| = 10 degrees. So, there\u2019s a 10-degree difference between the two temperatures. [p] \n\nLet\u2019s take a moment to explore absolute value in graphs. When graphing absolute values on a coordinate plane, we will typically see a V-shaped graph. The V-shape represents that, regardless of whether you are dealing with positive or negative numbers, the outputs will always be non-negative. For instance, if we graph the equation y = |x|, we will see this V-shape where y is always positive or zero. [p] \n\nWhat about word problems that require absolute value? Consider a scenario where you need to find how far someone is from their home if they moved to positions 10 meters east and 7 meters west. In this case, we treat east as positive and west as negative, setting it up as follows: 10 + (-7) = 3. This will tell us that they are 3 meters east from their home. To generalize this idea, we can say absolute value reflects the distance from a specific point, such as your house. [p] \n\nTo sum it all up: Today, you\u2019ve learned about integers and absolute values, and how they can be applied through various real-world situations. We tackled word problems involving integers through examples of temperature changes, financial transactions, and elevation levels to see how integers work. We further explored absolute value, which teaches us how far a number is from zero, and learned about its application on graphs and real-life distance problems. Understanding these concepts is vital in mathematics and everyday life, as they help us quantify changes and distances effectively. Well done today! You have grasped these essential mathematical concepts! [p] ",
