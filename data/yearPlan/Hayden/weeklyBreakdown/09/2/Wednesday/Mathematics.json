                "lecture": "Welcome back! Yesterday, we practiced operations with rational numbers. Today, we will focus on applying what you've learned to real-world problems involving rational numbers. Rational numbers are numbers that can be expressed as a fraction where the numerator and denominator are both integers. Examples include \n- 1/2, \n- -3/4, and \n- 5.75. \n\nLet's start by discussing how we encounter rational numbers in daily life. Consider scenarios like shopping or cooking. When measuring ingredients, you might use fractions like 1/4 cup of sugar or 1/2 teaspoon of salt. Similarly, while shopping, if an item is half off, it can be expressed as a fraction of its original price. Using fractions helps us calculate discounts or portions accurately. [p] Now, let's move on to solving real-world problems. Imagine you have a recipe that requires 3/4 cup of flour, but you want to make only half of the recipe. How would you determine the amount of flour needed?\nTo solve this, you would multiply the fraction 3/4 by 1/2. \nUsing multiplication of fractions means multiplying the numerators together and the denominators together. Thus, (3 \n* 1) / (4 * 2) = 3/8. You would need 3/8 cup of flour for half of the recipe. This is how fractions work in practical contexts. [p] Next, let\u2019s examine more examples of solving everyday problems involving rational numbers. Say you\u2019re tracking your savings. If you saved 3/5 of your monthly allowance and then earned an additional 1/10, how would you express your total savings? Convert these fractions to have a common denominator to add them correctly, which in this case is 10.\nRewrite 3/5 as 6/10, leading to:\n6/10 + 1/10 = 7/10, meaning your total savings would then be 7/10 of your allowance saved so far. You see how we apply rational numbers to keep track of commitments and transactions. [p] Now, let\u2019s talk about interpreting fractions further. Fractions are a key component in rational numbers because they give meaning to portions of a whole. If you have a pizza divided into 8 equal slices and eat 3 of them, you can express how much pizza is left in fractions. \nYou consumed 3/8 of the pizza, leaving 5/8. The same idea applies in various contexts like time management or measurements. When looking at example scenarios, it\u2019s important to visualize splitting whole quantities to understand the representations of these fractions clearly. [p] Fractions allow us to describe situations more precisely and improve clarity.",
