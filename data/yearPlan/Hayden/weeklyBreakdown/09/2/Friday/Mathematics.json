                "lecture": "Hello! Yesterday, we compared rational numbers and really focused on understanding their place on the number line. Today, we'll review everything we've learned about rational numbers with practice exercises and a review game. Let's start by recalling what rational numbers are. They are numbers that can be expressed as the quotient of two integers, where the denominator is not zero. For instance, \n\n1.5 is a rational number because it can be written as 3/2. Similarly, -4 is rational since it can be expressed as -4/1. \n\nNow that we understand rational numbers, let's move on to practice problems. This is the best way to solidify our knowledge. I will present a variety of problems involving addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division of rational numbers. You will be working through these problems, and I\u2019ll guide you as you tackle them.\n\nHere\u2019s our first practice problem: Add these two rational numbers together, 3/4 + 1/2. Take a moment to solve this, and remember to find a common denominator first.  \n\n[p] \n\nOnce you have your answer, we will move on to subtraction. For the next problem, consider this: Subtract 1/3 from 5/6. Write your answer as a simplified fraction.  \n\n[p] \n\nGreat job on those! Now let\u2019s shift gears a bit and help you while making it a little fun by playing a review game! This game will reinforce what you\u2019ve learned through competition. I\u2019ll ask a question, and the first one to respond correctly gets a point. \n\nOur first question is: What is the result of multiplying -2/5 by 15/4? Think carefully about your answer. \n\n[p] \n\nExcellent responses! We\u2019ll keep track of points as we go along to see how well you understand these concepts. Remember to communicate if you have any doubts!\n\nAs we finish, let's take a short $Break time and when we return, we will dive into more complex problems and address any final queries you may have! \n\nThe deeper we go, the more you\u2019ll realize how rational numbers are integral in understanding more advanced mathematics. Are you ready for more practice? \n\nAfter this break, we will continue with advanced exercises to ensure you are comfortable.\n\nAs a brief summary of what you've learned today: you\u2019ve covered an extensive review of rational numbers with practice problems focused on addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division. You also engaged in an interactive game which reinforced your understanding of these concepts. Remember, practice makes progress, and mastering these topics will greatly assist you in future mathematical challenges. \n\nLet's continue this positive momentum!",
