                "lecture": "Welcome to today\u2019s lesson! We will review all that we've learned this week about Parts of Speech. Parts of Speech are the building blocks of language, and today, we\u2019ll engage with them in a dynamic way. \n\nLet's begin with a quick review. We have learned about the eight main parts of speech: nouns, pronouns, verbs, adjectives, adverbs, conjunctions, prepositions, and interjections. Each part plays a crucial role in forming sentences that convey meaning and express ideas.\n\nNouns are words that name a person, place, thing, or idea. For example, in the sentence 'The cat sat on the mat,' both 'cat' and 'mat' are nouns. [p] Now, what about verbs? Verbs are action words. They tell us what the subject does, or what happens. In our example, \u2018sat\u2019 is the verb. [p] Let's not forget about adjectives, which describe nouns, and adverbs, that modify verbs, adjectives, or other adverbs. For instance, in 'The quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog,' the words \u2018quick,\u2019 \u2018brown,\u2019 and \u2018lazy\u2019 provide more detail about the nouns, while \u2018jumps\u2019 is the action word.\n\nNow that we have refreshed our memories about these parts of speech, we\u2019re going to take a quiz to assess your understanding. This quiz will test your knowledge on identifying these parts in sentences. [p] As we go through the quiz, remember to think critically about each sentence. Why is a word classified as a noun, verb, or any other part of speech? [p] Once we finish the quiz, we will discuss your answers and clarify any misunderstandings.\n\nThis review and assessment will help solidify your knowledge, and prepare you for more complex sentence structures and language applications in the future. So let\u2019s dive into the quiz now and see how well you can identify these essential components of language. [p]\n\nConsider the sentences carefully, mark your answers, and remember, even if you make mistakes, those are learning opportunities! After the quiz, I will be here to discuss your answers and provide further insights to help enhance your understanding of Parts of Speech.\n\nLet\u2019s get started! Good luck!",
