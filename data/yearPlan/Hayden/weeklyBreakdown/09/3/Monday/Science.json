                "title": "Review of States of Matter",
                "lecture": "Today, we will review the three main states of matter: solid, liquid, and gas. Understanding these states is crucial, as they form the foundation of how we interact with the physical world around us. Let's start with solids. Solids have a definite shape and volume. This means that the particles in a solid are closely packed together and vibrate in place, rather than moving freely. An everyday example of a solid is a rock or a chair. The particles in these materials are tightly bonded together, which gives them structure.\n\nNow, let's discuss liquids. Liquids have a definite volume but take the shape of their container. This means that the particles in a liquid are still close together but can move past each other. A common example of a liquid is water. When you pour water into a glass, it takes the shape of the glass, but it still retains a specific volume.\n\nFinally, we have gases. Gases have neither a definite shape nor a definite volume. The particles in a gas are far apart and move freely. An example of a gas is the air we breathe. When you inflate a balloon, you're filling it with air, which spreads out to fill the entire balloon.\n\nLet's pause here to reflect on what we\u2019ve covered about the three states of matter: solids hold their shape, liquids take the shape of their container, and gases fill the space available to them. [p]\n\nNow that we\u2019ve reviewed the states of matter, let\u2019s explore phase changes. Phase changes involve transitions from one state of matter to another. This can happen in several ways: for instance, when a solid melts, it becomes a liquid; when a liquid freezes, it becomes a solid.\n\nTwo common phase changes are evaporation and condensation. Evaporation occurs when a liquid turns into a gas. This happens, for example, when water on a hot day evaporates into water vapor. Conversely, condensation is the process where a gas turns back into a liquid; a common example of this is when you see water droplets forming on a cold glass. \n\n[p]\n\nTo summarize what we\u2019ve discussed, phase changes include melting, freezing, evaporation, and condensation. Each of these changes is a transformation between the states of matter. Now, let\u2019s explore some examples of each state of matter in everyday life. As we\u2019ve seen, solids include items like ice, while liquids include milk and juice. On the gas end, we have the steam from a kettle or the air filling a balloon. \n\nThese examples highlight how we encounter different states of matter daily and how the phase changes between them impact our lives. \n\nTo summarize, today you learned about the three states of matter: solids, liquids, and gases. You also explored phase changes like melting, freezing, evaporation, and condensation, and how these concepts manifest in everyday life. \n\nNow, don\u2019t forget to review the material when studying, and consider how these states of matter and their changes affect both science and daily activities!",
