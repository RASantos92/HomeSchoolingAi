                "lecture": "Welcome back! In our last session, we focused on solving complex problems that involve ratios and proportions. Today, we will shift gears and focus on creating our own real-life problems that involve ratios and proportions. This interactive exercise will help you deepen your understanding of these mathematical concepts by applying them creatively.\n\nFirst, let's talk about how we can frame our own problems. When creating ratio and proportion problems, it's important to think about the context. For example, consider situations like cooking, shopping, or mixing solutions where ratios naturally come into play. What real-life scenarios can you think of that would involve ratios? [p]\n\nNow, think about the format of your problems. For instance, if you decide to create a cooking problem, you might ask, \"If a recipe requires 2 cups of flour for every 3 cups of sugar, how much flour is needed for 12 cups of sugar?\" This not only reinforces your understanding of ratios but also challenges your problem-solving skills when thinking about scales.\n\nAs we create these problems, I encourage you to imagine various fields where ratios and proportions might be useful such as architecture, art, or sports. This will help you come up with exciting and diverse problems for others to solve. [p]\n\nNext, let\u2019s take a moment to discuss group discussions on solutions. After you\u2019ve created your problems, it's beneficial to form pairs or small groups\u2014if possible\u2014to share your problems with each other. In these discussions, explain your thought process behind your problem and hear how your peers approached theirs.\n\nThis has several benefits: it helps you articulate your understanding, it allows for collaborative learning, and it helps illuminate different methods of solving similar problems. As you share your work, think critically about the feedback you receive and how you might improve your problem creation skills. [p] \n\nFinally, let\u2019s explore peer teaching techniques. Teaching others is a powerful way to reinforce your own learning. When you explain how to solve a problem to someone else, you're forced to clarify your own understanding of the subject. So, after discussing and refining your problems with peers, try to teach your problem to another student.\n\nThis could involve not just telling them the solution but guiding them through your thought process or the reasoning behind your problem. Think of it as a mini-workshop where you learn from each other and enhance your own understanding of ratios and proportions. [p] \n\nNow that we\u2019ve walked through the process of problem creation, group discussions, and peer teaching, let\u2019s take a short break to refresh our minds. $Break time  \n\n[15 minutes later] \n\nLet\u2019s regroup and share some examples of the problems you created! This will allow you to apply what we\u2019ve discussed collaboratively and critically assess each other\u2019s problems. This approach will not only help you solidify your understanding but will also engage you in this interactive learning process. [p]\n\nAs we conclude today\u2019s lecture, remember that creating problem scenarios that apply the concepts of ratios and proportions is not only a good learning tool but also a fun exercise that can lead to insightful discussions and discoveries. Be sure to reflect on what you learned today and think about how you can apply these methods in future lessons.\n\nWhat we learned today can be summed up in the following points:\n1. You can create your own ratio and proportion problems based on real-life scenarios which enhances your understanding of these concepts.\n2. Group discussions on solutions can reveal alternative approaches to problem-solving and deepen comprehension.\n3. Peer teaching reinforces knowledge as it requires clear explanation of your thought processes.\n\nThank you for participating actively today! I look forward to seeing how you apply these techniques in your mathematical journeys!",
