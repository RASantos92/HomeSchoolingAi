                "lecture": "Welcome to today's lecture! As we delve deeper into the periodic table, today\u2019s focus will be on understanding isotopes and how they differ from regular elements. Isotopes are variants of a particular chemical element which differ in neutron number, and consequently, in nucleon number. For instance, while carbon-12 has 6 protons and 6 neutrons, carbon-14, another isotope of carbon, has 6 protons and 8 neutrons. [p] This difference in neutron number can affect several physical properties of the isotopes, but they still keep the same chemical behavior since they have the same number of protons and electrons. [p] Next, we will explore some common applications of isotopes. One notable application is in radiometric dating, where isotopes are used to determine the age of rocks and fossils based on the decay of certain isotopes. Carbon-14 dating, for example, is invaluable for archeology to date organic materials up to about 50,000 years old. [p] Furthermore, isotopes are crucial in understanding geological formations and processes. [p] Now let's discuss some of the medical applications of isotopes. In medicine, isotopes are extensively utilized for diagnostic imaging and treatment. For example, iodine-131 is used in diagnosing and treating thyroid conditions due to its ability to concentrate in the thyroid gland. [p] Similarly, Technetium-99m is widely used in medical imaging due to its favorable physical properties and short half-life, allowing physicians to obtain images of organs and detect diseases effectively. [p] Understanding isotopes also helps in the development of targeted therapies, where specific isotopes are used to increase treatment efficacy while minimizing damage to surrounding healthy tissue. [p] As we wrap up today's discussion, it\u2019s important to remember the role isotopes play not just in earth sciences, but also in advancing medical technologies that save lives and improve quality of care. [p] Overall, today you have learned about the definition of isotopes, their applications in various fields, especially in medicine. The differences between isotopes and regular elements set a foundation for understanding basic chemistry and its implications in real life. [p] Now, let's take a recap of what we have covered today: the definition of isotopes, their applications including dating techniques, and specific medical uses such as diagnostic imaging and treatment.",
