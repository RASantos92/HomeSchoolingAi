                "lecture": "Hello! Today, we\u2019re going to expand our knowledge of percentages by diving into the concept of ratios. Ratios are a fundamental mathematical concept and they often come up in various everyday situations. We can think of a ratio as a way to compare two quantities. For example, if there are 2 apples and 3 oranges, we can express that as the ratio of apples to oranges, written as 2:3. This ratio shows us how the quantity of one item compares to another. Understanding ratios is essential because they lay the groundwork for understanding percentages.\n\nNow, let\u2019s consider how ratios are used in real life. Ratios appear in recipes, maps, financial analyses, and even sports statistics. For instance, if a recipe for a cake calls for 2 cups of flour to 3 cups of sugar, that ratio helps you maintain the right flavor balance in your cake. Similarly, in a financial context, a ratio can compare profitability between two companies. [p] \n\nNext, we will explore how to convert ratios to percentages. To do this, you take the ratio and divide the part by the whole. If our ratio is 2:3, we can express it as a fraction: 2/(2 + 3) = 2/5. To convert this fraction into a percentage, we multiply by 100. So, (2/5) * 100 = 40%. So this means that if you have 2 parts of a total of 5 parts, that\u2019s 40% of the whole. [p] \n\nNow that you have a grasp of ratios and their importance in real life and conversion to percentages, it's time to practice. Let\u2019s move on to some practice problems where we will apply this knowledge to various scenarios.",
                "summary": "In today\u2019s lesson, you've learned about the relationship between percentages and ratios. We discussed how to express ratios and their implications in real-life situations, like cooking and finance. Additionally, you\u2019ve learned how to convert ratios into percentages, a skill that is essential for understanding and analyzing data. \n\nTo summarize, we covered:\n1. Understanding Ratios and Proportions\n2. Ratios in Real Life\n3. Converting Ratios to Percentages\nRemember, the more you practice these concepts, the better you'll understand their application!",
