                "lecture": "Welcome to today\u2019s mathematics lesson! After discussing practical applications of percentages, we will review how to solve problems involving percentage change and profit calculations today.\n\nLet\u2019s start with the first topic, which is the formulas for percentage increase and decrease. \n\nA percentage increase occurs when the final amount is greater than the original amount. The formula for calculating the percentage increase is:\n\nPercentage Increase = ((New Value - Old Value) / Old Value) * 100.\n\nFor example, if an item\u2019s price increases from $50 to $65, you would calculate the percentage increase as follows:\n\n1. Subtract the old value from the new value: 65 - 50 = 15.\n2. Then divide by the old value: 15 / 50 = 0.3.\n3. Finally, multiply by 100 to get the percentage: 0.3 * 100 = 30%.\n\nThis means there is a 30% increase in price.\n\nOn the other hand, a percentage decrease happens when the value decreases. The formula for percentage decrease is:\n\nPercentage Decrease = ((Old Value - New Value) / Old Value) * 100.\n\nFor instance, if an item\u2019s price falls from $80 to $60:\n\n1. Subtract the new value from the old value: 80 - 60 = 20.\n2. Divide by the old value: 20 / 80 = 0.25.\n3. Multiply by 100: 0.25 * 100 = 25%.\n\nTherefore, you have a 25% decrease in price.\n[p]\n\nNow, let\u2019s move on to understanding profit margins, which are critical in business settings. The profit margin indicates how much profit a company makes on its sales. To find the profit margin percentage, you can use the formula:\n\nProfit Margin = (Profit / Revenue) * 100.\n\nWhere Profit is defined as the revenue (sales) minus total costs.\n\nFor example, if a company sells a product for $200 and it costs $150 to produce it:\n\n1. Profit = Revenue - Cost = 200 - 150 = 50.\n2. Profit Margin = (50 / 200) * 100 = 25%.\n\nThus, the profit margin is 25%, meaning that 25% of the revenue is profit. Higher profit margins indicate a more profitable business.\n[p]\n\nNow, let\u2019s put some of this knowledge into practice with some practice problems. I will present you with three different scenarios, and you will calculate the percentage increase, percentage decrease, and profit margin.\n\nScenario 1: A dress originally priced at $100 is now sold for $120. What is the percentage increase?\n\nScenario 2: A laptop was bought for $800 and sold for $640. What is the percentage decrease?\n\nScenario 3: A company generates $500,000 in sales, but their costs total $350,000. What is the profit margin?\n\nTake your time to solve these problems, and remember to apply the formulas we discussed today. \n[p]\n\nOnce you have your answers, we can review them.\n\n$Break time\n\nNow that we have returned from our break, let\u2019s check the answers:\n\nFor Scenario 1, the percentage increase from $100 to $120 is a 20% increase. For Scenario 2, the laptop's percentage decrease from $800 to $640 is a 20% decrease. And for Scenario 3, the profit margin calculated with $500,000 in sales and $350,000 in costs is a profit margin of 30%.\n\nMoving forward, these calculations can help you understand how percentages play a crucial role in finance, business, and everyday life. Learning to navigate these concepts will enhance your mathematical skills and your real-world knowledge of finance.\n[p]",
