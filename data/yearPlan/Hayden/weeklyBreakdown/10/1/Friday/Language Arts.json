                "lecture": "Welcome to our final lesson on punctuation! I hope you've gained a clear understanding of its importance in writing. Today, we will engage in various activities to consolidate your learning. In this session, we'll start with a review of the key punctuation marks we've covered: commas, periods, question marks, exclamation points, and quotation marks. Each of these marks plays a crucial role in ensuring clarity and meaning in your writing.  \nAs a quick refresher, commas are used to separate items in a list, while periods signal the end of a sentence. Question marks indicate inquiries, exclamation points convey strong emotion, and quotation marks highlight spoken dialogue. [p]  \nNow that we've reviewed these basics, let's dive into some practice. I want you to take a few minutes to write down a short paragraph using at least five different punctuation marks. Remember to pay attention to how each mark influences the tone and clarity of your writing.  \nOnce you\u2019ve written your paragraph, we\u2019ll share our work with each other. This is a great opportunity to get feedback and enhance your understanding through peer discussion.  \n[p]  \nNext, we will have a punctuation quiz. This quiz will test your knowledge and understanding of the punctuation rules we've discussed. It will include exercises on identifying punctuation errors, correcting sentences, and applying the rules in various contexts. Be sure to read each question carefully and show what you've learned! [p]  \nAfter the quiz, we will transition into our creative writing assignments. Here, you'll choose a creative writing prompt, and I encourage you to heavily incorporate punctuation into your story or poem to express your ideas vividly. Think about how different punctuation marks can change the mood of your piece and really engage with your reader. You'll have some time to draft your writing, and afterwards, we will have the chance to share our pieces! [p]  \nAs we wrap up, remember that punctuation is not just about rules; it's about conveying your ideas clearly and effectively. I am excited to see how you apply what you've learned.  \nTo summarize our lesson today: We reviewed the essential punctuation marks, engaged in practice writing, participated in a quiz, and began our creative writing assignments where we apply punctuation in a more artistic context. I hope you've felt empowered to use punctuation in your writing with confidence!",
