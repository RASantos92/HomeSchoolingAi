                "title": "Understanding Percentages",
                "lecture": "In today's math lesson, we will focus on percentages. We will learn how to calculate percentages and understand their real-life applications. Let\u2019s begin by discussing what a percentage actually is. A percentage is a ratio expressed as a fraction of 100. This means that when we say '50%', we are referring to 50 out of 100 parts. It helps us express how much we have in relation to a whole. Understanding percentages is crucial in daily life\u2014think about sales tax, discounts, or even tips at restaurants! [p]  \n\nNow, let\u2019s dive into the first subtopic: Finding percentages of a number. To find the percentage of a given number, you multiply the number by the percentage expressed as a decimal. For instance, to find 20% of 50, you would convert 20% to a decimal, which is 0.20, and then multiply: 50 x 0.20 = 10. This shows you that 20% of 50 is 10. Remember that understanding how to find percentages can help you figure out discounts when shopping or tips when dining out. [p] \n\nLet's take a break here. $Break time  \n\nWelcome back! Now that we understand how to find percentages of a number, let\u2019s move on to our second subtopic: Converting fractions to percentages. To convert a fraction into a percentage, you need to divide the top number by the bottom number and then multiply by 100. For example, for the fraction 3/4, you divide 3 by 4 to get 0.75, and then you multiply 0.75 by 100, which gives you 75%. This tells us that 3 out of 4 parts represents 75% of the whole. It\u2019s a simple process but incredibly useful in various situations, especially in finance and statistics. [p]  \n\nLet\u2019s pause again. $Break time  \n\nNow, for our final subtopic: Percentage increase and decrease. This concept is particularly useful in understanding how values change over time. To find the percentage increase, you subtract the original number from the new number, divide that amount by the original number, and then multiply by 100. For example, if a shirt originally costs $20 and is now $30, the increase is $10. Dividing $10 by $20 gives us 0.5, and multiplying by 100 tells us that it is a 50% increase. Conversely, for percentage decrease, the process is similar. You\u2019d subtract the new number from the original number instead. Taking the shirt again, if it was $30 but is now $20, the decrease is $10, giving you a 33.33% decrease after calculating as shown. Understanding these concepts can equip you with skills to make better financial decisions and evaluations in various real-life situations. [p]\n\nLet\u2019s take one more brief break before our summary. $Break time  \n\nAs we wrap up our lecture today, let's recap what we have learned about percentages. We began with understanding the basic definition of percentages and their importance in everyday life. We then explored how to find the percentage of a number, and learned how to convert fractions to percentages. Lastly, we examined how to calculate both percentage increases and decreases, which helps us understand changes in values over time. Remember, why percentages matter: they can affect everything from budgets to sales. Keep practicing these calculations in your daily life, and it will become second nature to you! \n\nThank you for joining me today in our exploration of percentages!",
