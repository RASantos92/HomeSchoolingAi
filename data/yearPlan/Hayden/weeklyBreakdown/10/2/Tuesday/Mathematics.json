                "lecture": "Continuing from our introduction yesterday, we will now practice simplifying and evaluating algebraic expressions. Algebraic expressions are combinations of numbers, variables, and operators that represent a mathematical relationship. To simplify them effectively, we need to focus on different strategies, starting with combining like terms.[p] \n\nLet\u2019s begin with the concept of combining like terms. Like terms are terms that contain the same variable raised to the same power. For instance, in the expression 3x + 5x, both terms are like terms because they both contain the variable x to the first power. To combine these terms, we simply add their coefficients. So, 3x + 5x equals 8x.[p] \n\nAlways remember that when combining like terms, the variables must be identical. If we take the expression 2x^2 + 3x + 4x^2, we can only combine the terms that have the same variable and exponent. Here, the like terms are 2x^2 and 4x^2. Adding these together gives us 6x^2, and the final simplified expression becomes 6x^2 + 3x.[p]\n\nNow, let's try a quick example together. Take the expression 4y + 7y - 2y. Can we combine like terms? Absolutely! We add up the coefficients: 4 + 7 - 2 equals 9. Thus, 4y + 7y - 2y simplifies to 9y. This technique is crucial for simplifying algebraic expressions and makes solving equations more manageable.[p]\n\nNext, let\u2019s delve into evaluating expressions. To evaluate an algebraic expression, you need to substitute a number for each variable in the expression. Consider the expression 2x + 3. If we want to evaluate this expression for x = 4, we would substitute 4 in place of x.[p]\n\nSo, we have 2(4) + 3, which simplifies to 8 + 3, resulting in 11. Evaluation allows us to see what the expression equals for various values of the variable, making it a vital skill in algebra.[p]\n\nFor instance, let\u2019s evaluate the expression 5y - 2 when y = 3. Substituting in, we have 5(3) - 2. This results in 15 - 2, equating to 13.[p]\n\nNow, let me introduce you to a more complex expression: 3a^2 + 2a - 5. If we want to evaluate this expression with a = 2, we need to substitute 2 into the expression: 3(2)^2 + 2(2) - 5.[p]\n\nLet\u2019s break it down. First, calculate (2)^2 which gives us 4. Multiplying that by 3 gives us 12. Then we compute 2(2), which is 4. Finally, we put this all together: 12 + 4 - 5 equals 11. Expression evaluation is powerful because it helps you apply the variables to real-world numbers.[p]\n\nNow, to summarize what we have discussed today: We explored how to combine like terms to simplify algebraic expressions, a crucial skill in algebra. We then examined evaluating expressions by substituting values for variables, gaining insight into how these expressions can represent different numerical values under different conditions.[p]\n\nPracticing these skills will significantly enhance your understanding of algebra, making it easier to solve equations and work with functions in the future. Remember, as you work through problems, take your time to ensure you identify like terms accurately and follow through with careful evaluations.\n\nBefore we conclude, I encourage you to explore more about algebraic expressions on Wikipedia.
